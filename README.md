# CitiBike Analysis

## Purpose
### CitiBike study goals
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize data from New York City's CitiBike program, with the intent to determine if a similar program would be well-received and well-utilized in the city of Des Moines, Iowa. Looking at the areas where CitiBike is most utilized, the time of day and demographic information of the top users, we can gather unique insights into the program and answer our questions.

## Results
### Data Analysis
In order to provide a visually informative analysis, reporting through Tableau is utilized to tell a story about the data. See the attached story which contains seven visualizations which depict the usage of CitiBike in New York City. Images like the one below the link are included in the story. This image depicts location of pickups in a stunning and easy to read way, as it imposes the locations on a map of Manhattan.

## Summary
### Topics for further exploration
While the attached story explains a lot about the clientele, usage, and timing of CitiBike's success in New York City, the dots are not yet connected to undestanding if the business venture would be reproducable in Des Moines. In order to do this, data sets should be sources which depict the population density and transportation style of inhabitants of both New York and Des Moines. Also, profit data for New York's CitiBike should be obtained. By comparing the two cities' density differences, and indexing this difference against the NYC profits, we can visualize what usage (and profit) may be in Des Moines. Once we understand this, we can make a business judgment on if the investment required to bring CitiBike to Des Moines would be worth the potential profit.

To recap, additional visualizations include:

- Density of New York City (people per square mile)
- Density of Des Moines (people per square mile)
- Profitability in New York City (actual)
- Potential Profitability in Des Moines (calculated)
